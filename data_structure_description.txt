The first line of the data structure is the accepting state, or “END.” 
This is designed to tell the program what the accepting state is so it 
can determine whether or not the given input string reaches the 
accepting state. The lines following the first line are the alphabet 
of the language, each separated by a new line character. After the 
alphabet is a blank line, to indicate that the alphabet section of the 
data structure ended. After the blank space is a list of all the 
transitions between the states, in the format:
<current_state> <item> <next_state>. 
This tells the program what each transition is, so the program can go 
through the transitions in order to determine if a given input follows 
the transitions in the NFA, to determine if it is a valid string in the 
language.
