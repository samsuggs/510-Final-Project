INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PYTHON PROGRAM:
 - This runs like any other python program
 - The best way to run this is either in a Python
   IDE, or just type in "python automation.py" in
   a terminal, given that you have the source code 
   and data structure file downloaded.
 - It will ask you to enter your desired input,
   and then it will accept/reject that input
 - If you want to enter another input, run the
   program again
 - Input should be formatted with each item
   separated by a single space, in a left to right,
   top to bottom order
 - Ex: _ iron _ _ stick _ _ stick _ would be a valid
   input for an iron shovel
